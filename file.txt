Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes. It enables code reusability and promotes a hierarchical structure in class relationships. In PHP, inheritance is achieved using the `extends` keyword.

Inheritance is considered beneficial in many cases because it offers several advantages:

1. Code Reusability: Inheritance allows you to define common properties and methods in a base class (also known as a parent or superclass) and reuse them in derived classes (also known as child or subclass). This promotes code reuse, reduces redundancy, and makes maintenance easier.

2. Modularity: Inheritance helps in creating modular code by organizing classes into a hierarchical structure. It allows you to create specialized classes that inherit the common behaviors of a parent class and add their own unique functionalities.

3. Polymorphism: Inheritance enables polymorphism, which means that objects of different classes can be treated as objects of the same base class. This allows for flexibility in programming and facilitates code extensibility.

4. Overriding and Extending: Inheritance allows derived classes to override or extend the functionality of their parent class. This means that you can modify the behavior of inherited methods in the derived class to suit specific requirements.

However, there are cases where inheritance might not be the best approach, and it's important to consider its implications:

1. Tight Coupling: Inheritance can lead to tight coupling between classes, where changes in the base class can affect derived classes. This can make the code more difficult to maintain and increase the risk of unintended side effects.

2. Inheritance Hierarchy Complexity: Inheritance hierarchies can become complex and hard to manage if not designed properly. It's crucial to carefully plan and structure the class hierarchy to avoid confusion and maintain code readability.

3. Limited Flexibility: Inheritance creates a strong relationship between classes, and changing the inheritance hierarchy can be challenging. It may restrict the flexibility to make changes in the future.

In conclusion, inheritance is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming that offers code reusability, modularity, and polymorphism. It is generally beneficial in promoting code organization and reducing duplication. However, like any programming concept, it should be used judiciously, considering the specific requirements and design goals of your application.
